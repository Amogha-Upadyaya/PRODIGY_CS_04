# PRODIGY_CS_04
The following repository documents the Task-04 assigned during my Cybersecurity Internship at Prodigy InfoTech

# Description
#### Aim
**Simple Key Logger** - Create a basic keylogger program that records and logs keystrokes. Focus on logging the keys pressed and saving them to a file. Note: Ethical considerations and permissions are crucial for projects involving keyloggers.

# Ethical Considerations
#### Warning!
The use of keyloggers can be illegal and unethical if used without explicit permission from the device owner. This project is intended strictly for educational purposes and should only be used in compliance with all applicable laws and regulatsions. Alwayes obtain proper authorization before using this software on any device.

# Setup
#### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- ```pynput``` library

#### Installation
1. Install the ```pynput``` library by executing the following bash command: ```pip install pynput```
2. Clone this repository or download the project files.

# Usage
1. Run the Keylogger - Execute ```main.py``` to start the key logger control interface: ```python main.py```
2. Control Menu
    1. Start Keylogger - Starts the keylogger if it is not already running
    2. Stop Keylogger - Stops the keylogger if it is running
    3. Exit - Stops the keylogger (if running) and exits the program

# Sample
#### When main.py is executed.
